    Works as follows:
        state - Board state (what cells are filled and with what color). Since there are many invalid board states,
                we decided to search for paths instead of individual cells, skipping many invalid routes.
        goal state - Given Board which is filled correctly.
        variables - Cell (x,y) on the board. Some of them has color coded number.
        domain - Different paths from (x,y) in length of the cell's number.
        constraints -
            # Cell must be assigned only 1 color
            # Cell with number most be assigned the same color as the number.
            # Colored cell must be part of a path of given length (Path is connected in both sides with numbered cell).

        Search - We use backtracking to for the search. Each time we find a path for 2 numbered cells at a time.
                 So we skip many invalid states.

        variable selection - We can choose the order of the cells assignment by changing the order of 'heads'
        domain selection - Each path can be scored using heuristic and than ordered from best to worst.
                           We can also remove path that will cause inevitable failure (blocking a cell from
                           forming a path)
